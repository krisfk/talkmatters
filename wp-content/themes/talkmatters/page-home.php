        <div class="mt-2  text-justify">Talking through our matters matters. Every day we experience our lives, we learn
            and we grow. This is unique to human nature and important for humanity to thrive. Via talking, our ancestors
            pass on knowledge between generations, in the creation of cult and culture; to connect in the community and
            to engage each other with trust, respect and understanding. Our daily events and encounters trigger
            emotions, at times positive and at times unwanted. Talking helps to activate our brain and allows proximity
            to the emotional part. We are then able to access the data and process our feelings more effectively.

        <div class="mt-2  text-justify">Negative feelings might trigger maladaptive behaviors that bring down the
            quality of life. This is something no one wants. Obtaining prolonged wellness requires us to take one step
            further, that is to understand the meaning behind what we feel. In our survival mode, emotional regulation
            is used to counter or avoid threats in the context of fight or flight mode. Feelings signal the brain and
            the body to react (simply speaking, angry feeling works with the brain and body to prepare for a fight; a
            scared emotion prepares for withdrawal).
            <br><br>
            Talk Matters presents an invitation to talk and walk together. By revisiting your experience and feelings
            that matter to you, you allow a moment to stay vulnerable; and to appreciate what you have gone through with
            kindness and compassion.
