        <h3>The process</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Interested client is requested to provide some personal information. We gather these data and medical
                history
                only
                because they are important to the therapy</li>
            <li>Therapy is primarily conversation-based allowing counsellor to conceptualize on clientâ€™s experience and
                suggest
                the
                most appropriate approach for alignment with the client.</li>
            <li>Self awareness and insights take time, the more open a client is, the more desirable will be the
                outcome.
                Please do
                anticipate change to take place gradually</li>
