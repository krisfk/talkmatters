        <h3>The process</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Interested client is requested to provide some personal information. We gather these data and medical
                history
                only
                because they are important to the therapy</li>
            <li>Therapy is primarily conversation-based allowing counsellor to conceptualize on client’s experience and
                suggest
                the
                most appropriate approach for alignment with the client.</li>
            <li>Self awareness and insights take time, the more open a client is, the more desirable will be the
                outcome.
                Please do
                anticipate change to take place gradually</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>The format
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Face to face preferred. Online meeting could be considered for special occasions</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>The duration
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Empirical evidence shows that it is common to see changes after 8 - 10 sessions of committed work. Each
                session
                may take place on a weekly basis and lasts for 60 mins. It is subj to ...
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How about if I don’t know what my issue is
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This uncertainty is not uncommon when we talk about emotions and feelings. Discomfort might last long
                or short,
                the magnitude may vary and it seems to come from no where. Indeed it could be life-stage specific,
                triggered by \
                contexts or consequential to a past event. No worry, it is counsellor’s role to gain clarity with you
                together.
            </li>
        </ul>
